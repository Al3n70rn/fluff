fluff
=====

Fluff is package that contains several scripts to produce pretty, publication-quality figures for next-generation sequencing experiments. I've tried to make sure the default settings produce figures that are ready to use.

It currently contains three scripts:
* fluff_heatmap.py
* fluff_profile.py
* fluff_bandplot.py

Plotting is handled by the excellent [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/) library, several image formats are supported (SVG, Postscript, PDF, PNG).
